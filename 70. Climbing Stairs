You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


=======================================================================================

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 0, b = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
