Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long left = 1, right = num;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = (left + right) >>> 1;
            if (mid * mid >= num) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left * left == num;
    }
}
